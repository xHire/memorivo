memorivo
========

About
-----
memorivo is a very simple replacement for a web service `memrise.com` or an
application `anki`. You only need Ruby to run it.

Vocabulary sheets
-----------------
Creating a vocabulary sheet is very easy. It is a plain-text file where each
line is of the following format:

    <word in the language you study>[TAB]<translation in your language>

For instance:

    koer	dog

Installation and usage
----------------------
Open a terminal and navigate into a directory where you want to have memorivo
installed. Then run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/xHire/memorivo.git

You can place your vocabulary sheets directly into the `memorivo/` directory.
Then from that directory run:

    $ ./memorivo estonian_01

Here, `estonian_01` is a file name of a vocabulary sheet.
